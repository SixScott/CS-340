How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  I make sure that my code is spaced out nicely to make it easier to read.I also put comments to explain the functionality so it is easier to track what is happening in that block of code
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  As a coimputer scientist I work on the projects in short broken up features at a time. This allows for easier testing and implentation of previous work.
  
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists help give access to the wealth of data available at a users fingertips via computers. This is important because it allows users to have a great user experience and interface to manipulate and access data.
